# Spell Checker

1. Write a print10 method that prints out the first 10 words of the dictionary array. Do not print out the whole array of 10,000 words!

2. Write a spellcheck method that takes a word as a parameter and returns true if it is in the dictionary array. It should return false if it is not found (When can you tell that you have not found a word in the dictionary?). Test your code below by changing the word sent to the spellcheck() method in main. This algorithm is called a linear search where we step through the array one element at a time (here the dictionary one word at a time) looking for a certain element.

3. Optional Challenge: Write a method printStartsWith(String) that prints out the words that start with a String of letters in the dictionary array. Your method should take a parameter for the firstLetters as a String. You could use the Java String startsWith() method here if youâ€™d like to, or use indexOf to see if the firstLetters is at index 0 of the string. This is not autograded.
